# Pdf player library for Sunbird platform!
Contains PDF player library components powered by angular. These components are designed to be used in sunbird consumption platforms *(mobile app, web portal, offline desktop app)* to drive reusability, maintainability hence reducing the redundant development effort significantly.

# Getting Started with different integrations steps
 The pdf player can be integrated as web component in plain javascript projects and as web component in angular apps and also as angular library in angular and mobile applications.

# Use as web components	
Any web application can use this library as a web component. It accepts couple of inputs and triggers some events back to the application.

Follow below-mentioned steps to use it in plain javascript project:

- Insert [library](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-4.5.0/web-component/sunbird-pdf-player.js) as below:
	```javascript
	<script type="text/javascript" src="sunbird-pdf-player.js"></script>
	```
- Update below script in index.html file 
	```javascript
      <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reflect-metadata/0.1.13/Reflect.min.js"
      integrity="sha512-jvbPH2TH5BSZumEfOJZn9IV+5bSwwN+qG4dvthYe3KCGC3/9HmxZ4phADbt9Pfcp+XSyyfc2vGZ/RMsSUZ9tbQ=="
      crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
	```

- Get sample playerConfig from here: [playerConfig](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-4.3.0/src/app/data.ts)

- Create a custom html element: `sunbird-pdf-player`
	```javascript
    const  pdfElement = document.createElement('sunbird-pdf-player');
   ```

- Pass data using `player-config`
	```javascript
	pdfElement.setAttribute('player-config', JSON.stringify(playerConfig));
	```

	**Note:** Attribute name should be in kebab-case regardless of the actual Attribute name used in the Angular app. The value of the attribute should be in **string** type, as web-component does not accept any objects or arrays.

- Listen for the output events: **playerEvent** and **telemetryEvent**

	```javascript
	pdfElement.addEventListener('playerEvent', (event) => {
		console.log("On playerEvent", event);
	});
	pdfElement.addEventListener('telemetryEvent', (event) => {
		console.log("On telemetryEvent", event);
	});
	```
- Append this element to existing element
	```javascript
	const  myPlayer = document.getElementById("my-player");
	myPlayer.appendChild(pdfPlayerElement);
	```
- Refer demo [example](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-4.5.0/web-component/index.html)

- To run the project, use the following command:
	```bash
	npm run build-web-component
	http-server --cors web-component .
	```
	open [http://127.0.0.1:8081/web-component/](http://127.0.0.1:8081/web-component/)
	**Note:** There are some request for which we need to run this on server, so we need to run this on server for demo purpose we are using [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

- ![demo](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-4.5.0/web-component/pdf-player-wc.png)

# Use as Web component  in the Angular app

- Copy the assets files from web component folder
  [assets](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/tree/release-5.2.0/web-component/assets) to assets folder

- Create sunbird folder inside assets folder, and copy [sunbird-pdf-player.js](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-5.2.0/web-component/sunbird-pdf-player.js) and  [styles.css](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-5.2.0/web-component/styles.css). and Add/import these enteries in angular json file inside scripts and styles respectively.

- Add the reflect-metadata script to index.html file
	```javascript
      <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/reflect-metadata/0.1.13/Reflect.min.js"
      integrity="sha512-jvbPH2TH5BSZumEfOJZn9IV+5bSwwN+qG4dvthYe3KCGC3/9HmxZ4phADbt9Pfcp+XSyyfc2vGZ/RMsSUZ9tbQ=="
      crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>
	```

- Import reflect-metadata in main.ts file 

	```javascript
  import 'reflect-metadata';
	```

- Import  CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA in app module

	```javascript
  import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';
	```

- Import  sunbird-pdf-player in component
    ```bash
    <sunbird-pdf-player  [playerConfig]="playerConfig" (playerEvent)="playerEvents($event)"
    (telemetryEvent)="playerTelemetryEvents($event)"></sunbird-pdf-player>
    ```

- Send input to render PDF player

Use the mock config in your component to send input to PDF player
Click to see the mock - [playerConfig](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-5.2.0/src/app/data.ts)
**Note:** : Send input config as string 


# Use as Angular library in angular app

For help getting started with a new Angular app, check out the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/cli).
If you have an Angular â‰¥ 9 CLI project, you could simply use our schematics to add sunbird-pdf-player library to it.

## Step 1: Installation

Just run the following:
```red
ng add @project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player-v9
```

It will install sunbird-pdf-player for the default application specified in your `angular.json`. If you have multiple projects and you want to target a specific application, you could specify the `--project` option

```red
ng add @project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player-v9 --project myProject
```
### Manual installation
If you prefer not to use schematics or want to add `sunbird-pdf-player-v9` to an older project, you'll need to do the following:

<details>
  <summary>Click here to show detailed instructions!</summary>
  
  #### 1. Install the packages:

  ```bash
  npm install @project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player-v9 --save
  npm install @project-sunbird/sb-styles --save
  npm install @project-sunbird/client-services --save
  ```

  #### 2. Include the sb-styles and assets in angular.json configuration:
    
  Add following under architect.build.assets and styles
  
  ```diff
  {
    ...
    "build": {
    "builder": "@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser",
    "options": {
      ...
      "assets": [
      ...
  +   {
  +    "glob": "**/*.*",
  +    "input": "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player-v9/lib/assets/",
  +    "output": "/assets/"
  +   }	
      ...    
      ],
      "styles": [
      ...
  +   "./node_modules/@project-sunbird/sb-styles/assets/_styles.scss"    
      ...
      ],
      ...
    }
  ```
  

  #### 3. Import the modules and components:

  Import the NgModule where you want to use:

  ```diff
+  import { SunbirdPdfPlayerModule } from '@project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player-v9';
  @NgModule({
    ...
+    imports: [SunbirdPdfPlayerModule],
    ...
  })
  export class YourAppModule { }
  
  ```

## Step 2: Send input to render PDF player

Use the mock config in your component to send input to PDF player
Click to see the mock - [playerConfig](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-pdf-player/blob/release-4.5.0/src/app/data.ts)
